To play locally, the game will need to be run on a localhost server.
This can be done by doing the following:

1. Navigate to game directory on terminal or your favorite shell.
  - Ex. cd /path/to/game/files
2. Run localhost utility, I personally the python package http.server.
  - Ex. python3 -m http.server
  
  Note: If you are not running python3 in your current configuration you can always use python2.7
  - Ex. python -m SimpleHttpServer
  
3. By default, the default port is 8000, therefore hop on your favorite browser and navigate to localhost:8000.

Recommended: Run game in a window with a smaller width, and avoid online communications, they are unavailable in a localhost. 
If you would like experience the game with online capabilites, feel free to play it on my website (Not available yet).

Functionality on Local Machine:

- Single-Player
- Local Multiplayer
